objectives.
    1. to use an external library to simplify tasks from earlier ORM lessons.
    2. Mange database tables and schemas withour ever wrtint SQL through Alembic.
    Use SQLAchemy to create, read updata and delete records in a SQL database.


Terms 
    1. Schema is the blueprint of a databse.
    describes how data relates to other data tables, columns and relationshipds between them.
    2. Persist - save a schema in a database.
    3. Engine - A python object that transaletes SQL to python and vice-versa.
    4. session - a ptyhon object that uses an engine to allow us to programatically interact with a databse
    5. Trasaction - a strategy for exectuting databse statements such that the groupsucceeds or fails as a unit.
    6. Migrations - the process of moving data from one or more database to one or more taret databases.

leaning ORMs and using sqlite3 and OOP in python to build tools that map python classes to databases tables is very useful 
but has limitations.
    1.It only works with one type of SQL dabase sqlite3
    2. It only create the funcitonality that we needed for several classes.
    3. We wont know how other groups' ORMs work.
    4. Others wont know how our ORM  works.

    SQLAlchemy is a popular python ORM.
